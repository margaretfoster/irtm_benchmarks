title: "Replication Script for IRT-M: Fast Item Response Theory With Interpretable Latent Dimensions"
output: html_document
---
This script to produce a central runtime file. 
These simulations present IRT-M speed and error across
a range of configurations. 
These sims no longer benchmarks against blavaan.
Last updated: `r Sys.time()`


# Simulations:
Run baseline simulations
50 reps each of:
N = 100, K = 10, lambda sparsity = 0.75
d = c(2, 4, 6, 8)

produces:

The scripts walk through IRT-M on a synthetic public opinion survey.
The results are based on our package vignette
